# Django-Rest-API

The aim of this repository is to give a general deployment example of a Machine Learning Model in a production API through Django.

"Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source." https://www.djangoproject.com

In this particular project, we are using a basic scikit-learn model for diabetes diagnosis based on different input variables. However, it can easily be modified for other models. The configuration includes changing the input in the views.py file and the database features that we want to store after each request that the api receives.
